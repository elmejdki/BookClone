## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby: v2.6.5p114
- Ruby on Rails v6.0.3.2
- Postgres: >= 9.5
- AWS credentials

### Setup

- Install gems with:

```
  bundle install
```

- Setup database with:

```
  rails db:create
  rails db:migrate
```

## IMPORTANT

**I used S3 AWS service in order to store images. Therefore, I used SECRET KEYS stored in environment variables on my development and production servers.**

- So if you have AWS credentials create a file an application.yml file inside config/ and put this your credentials in it like showing bellow:

```ruby
  development:
    access_key_id: your_access_key_id_goes_here
    secret_access_key: your_secrect_access_key_goes_here
```

### Usage
Start server with:

```
  rails s
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
